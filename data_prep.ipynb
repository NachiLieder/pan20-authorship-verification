       "'[\\'\"Ja.\" Ludwig kept his gaze upon her, solidly. He dared. Isten, she thought, and almost crossed herself. Then the anger came; and it pulsed and pushed at her every pore, only leaking out as cold sweat-the discovery, the confirmation; the outrage. She was not angry at Ludwig-she knew better. She was only angry at something...and that something held Gilbert\"s life in its claws. Der Führer?-no, he was not worth it. The Reich?-no, that was not enough. The people?-now, it could never be the people\"s fault, not to be spoken outright; they had fault, but they were the ones who suffered and were pardoned. But now, she knew. She knew what had slammed the great Prussia into a mold of tin, one so thin, yet so strong, only diamonds could even scratch it-solidity was not needed, but the soft, the formless. She knew what had created the stoic of a man she had fallen in love with-because she had, and that was all she could say of it-and had given her such a wholesome slice of epiphany, fraught with beautiful little fillings of emotion. This was what had shrouded the heated heart of a youth and elder-this was so obvious, and yet so obscure, and in the end all so ridiculous but so very real. Name it. Looking down at her dusty shoes, breaking the line of watching with the young German nation, she wondered. Who triggered such a crackle of change, such a complete rain of metal?-Ludwig, surely, for he was his brother. Roderich, perhaps-for without him, Gilbert had nothing to cling onto, as a sort of constant target of his ridicule. No fun, no rivalry-without Roderich, there was nothing but power, and even Gilbert wanted something other than that, much as he loved it. Even her. Elizaveta\"s fingers tightened about the slips of deathly paper, now gray with dust. They had been friends and rivals as younglings-they had provided for each other someone close but distant, something that was hateful, but something they would mourn if he died. Looking back up, she glared. Isten, she thought, staring at the hues of those blue, blue eyes, it\"s so powerful it can even affect Prussia himself. \"You pushed him into this,\" she croaked, for suddenly dust was crowding her throat; abruptly it was there, and she breathed it. Still, she pressed on, ignoring that dull pain and sharp crackles as she spoke, as she breathed. \"His people suffered so much more...\" \"I know,\" he said, slowly but quickly at the same time. \"I know...\" The last bit was a breath, and Elizaveta sucked in another dusty one for herself. \"But he loved you...\" Was that accusation in her voice?-Ludwig did not deserve this-perhaps he did, but who was she to judge?-she had seen him as a child, about as much as Veneziano. Bias was not to be directed at him, though he had done much to cause this reign of hell, and change. So much change... \"He hated what you were doing\"-and now she was stating the obvious-\"but he saw some hope in it. But all this has shown him-\" here, on strange impulse, she spread her arms, for the dusty sky \"-that it\"s a hopeless cause. \"And he suffered so much. His people...he cares about them as much as the next. Nation...\" She choked, then, realizing her mistake-tears welled in her eyes, and she stayed them for postponement. \"He cared about them,\" she croaked. \"He cared, and loved them as much as the next nation, but he shows it differently. Showed it differently. His character was unique amongst people, nations or not.\" Then she stopped. She did not need to ramble, to tell Ludwig what the both of them knew very well. Neither of them was foolish enough to be superficial, after all. Still, Ludwig stood, awkwardly, unblinkingly. Elizaveta blinked; those tears, those damned tears squeezed from the cramped space-one flowed down each cheek; with something of a huff that did not break the atmosphere, she swept them away with a hand. Her hand came away dirty. \"...And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts Into the lean and slipper\"d pantaloon...\" - Shakespeare PT: I\"m back from the Mediterranean, oh yes. I\"ll spare you the glorious, rambling details xD Anyways, sorry this chapter came out much later than expected-I sort of stalled a bit out of a slight shake of writer\"s block. And school -did- hold me back-three projects-one in which the meetings for it went horribly wrong-a Japanese test, a commission for my school\"s newspaper on my trip, Promotion Board (I FAILED, I MUST\"VE D8), and formal inspection. -Shifty eyes- ...Those two crack stories posted by my friends?-my computer had been taken at that time, so...aiya... Back now. The next chapter -should- make you guys happy~ And I am sorely tempted to ramble about recently learning to play the gu zheng, but the unnecessary mention is more than enough. -Bows- - Well, since I\"d already used Frau and Herr-and in one of my past publications, Xian Sheng-I\"d deemed it only appropriate that I write \"Ms.\" in Italian. San will definitely stick out, and I can\"t use Miss when I\"ve already abused the other languages. - Veneziano. I\"ve kicked him out for the moment on purpose. He\"ll come back later. - Next chapter is, in fact, second to last. And the movie, Red Cliff. Both parts. Go watch them. NAO. \"...With spectacles on nose and pouch on side, His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide...\" - Shakespeare Death was displeased. Spoiled brat that it is. And even after a gluttonous meal... This was a festival for one, after all, and that one was Death, was the bitter thought that ran through the heads of all. Damnation and hellfire to their enemies. The end was nigh, though. Elizaveta shrugged to herself as the Russians marched in and granted her liberation. Liberation-no, it was just some sort of sick version of abduction, and resistance helped little-was nothing but another wretched road, another battle to fight. Staring into grape-like eyes, she noted Ivan\"s berth, his mad, mad eyes. His uniform. His little grin. The gloating of a child. \"All will become one with Russia,\" he said, almost simply, his cheer eerie. Fists were already clenched; now they groped about, for a pan, a rifle, a sword-there was nothing. In some way, this brought her but a sigh of relief-Gilbert and Roderich, she was reminded, were not here to suffer as well. If Ivan put his giant hands on Roderich... Click, went an object, and Elizaveta was snapped into the world when her own instincts pulled her head away; on time, for Ivan\"s collar was soon found to be touching the tip of her nose: she went cross-eyed staring at the thing: it pinched her skin, now red with anger. How dare you- Oppression! No one could lay that yoke above her again!-she would never allow it! Even when a sort of purple shroud seemed to wrap itself about Ivan and blaze as a fire would...even as a faint eerie \"kolkolkol\" was thick in the air...Elizaveta held her ground-glaring, hating, repulsing. Oppression. No more oppression...! His eyes dropped; his hand followed: with a bolt of alarm-lechery?-feint?-Elizaveta took one step back, bristling as the wolf does. Watching the muscles of the Russian arms twitch, she ducked when he snatched at where her waist would have been had she remained still; with a quick flush of indignation, she glared upward; if only Ludwig had not been forced out! He had retreated with such haste, back to Berlin, offering to bring her with him, though knowing that she would not leave-Hungary was her, and her place. So he had left, alone and resigned to the fact that even Veneziano had to leave him, taken by the Allies. Elizaveta had watched him go with as much resignation. Endsieg, the Germans called it. Ivan was huge, behemoth above an ant...no, not an ant, but perhaps a lotus...perhaps a hybrid of that with a rose. There is no rose without thorns, after all. The Soviets had already been merciless, ruthless as the next army: the ache of rape and massacre fluttered about the land. If anything, the nation itself would fight. Useless as it was. Ivan dropped the collar. Still galvanizing with mental shocks down the spine, she watched closely. Too closely. Ivan\"s hand dove downwards and snatched. With a horrified she jumped back, giving a swift right hook to his neck, the closest she could reach. -And in the end, it almost didn\"t matter. Ivan smiled triumphantly as a long-forgotten weight was shifted from her belt. With a savage look from one of him and Elizaveta, the paper was in between his fingers...Elizaveta looked, stunned-in the moment it felt as if the appendix had been removed from her body. As useless yet familiar thing was there, the memory of its origins...filled with not blood, but gore-milk skin against the universe of deadness. The paper was scrolled about the Russian\"s fingers; somehow, it completed the image-a bloody Soviet, grinning wickedly as the royal purple billowed from his eyes: to top it all off, a dirty cream paper twisted about his raised digits. It was almost gray. She had long since forgotten about the thing; the small text, written in Gilbert\"s-a frantic parry-handwriting; out fell a finger, and it was the one from the bombed wreck. Just its weight-it had been there all along, useless, a little keepsake of Berlin; what she had seen there. What she had left behind for her own Hungarian version. It was white still, yet shriveled, and dry-that was all; it had changed, though not enough. \"German,\" Ivan said, warmly-no, coldly...swelteringly icy, and that was oxymoronic, but oxymoronic was practically the composure of him...him, all him. \"This is a finger from Germany, da?\" \"How do you...\" She sucked in a breath; refused to let her eyes widen. The grin widened; \"Just a lucky guess.\" He giggled, sickeningly, violet mist shrouding the remains of his person; his teeth were a white and perfect-they flashed in the buttercup sun, which laid its yellow upon the stiff white ground, touched with chill. Elizaveta stood stock-still then: she did the whole time; something had been torn away, and it lay resting among Ivan\"s grubby fingers, clad in leather-worn leather gloves that anyone would wear these days...she rubbed at her own, slightly shredded, at the still-clothed fingertips. Hands-they were worn down: hers and Ivan\"s. Beaten flesh. Looking up again, relief flashed briefly, the white light stark against her crimson crumbling heart, or else the mind-one was meaningful as the other; with that thought, of Roderich, Gilbert, Ludwig, Veneziano, and the war as a human, Ares... Endsieg. There was nothing to lose, but more lives. Eyeing the Russians, who had swept her land into scorched blood, she charged. There was nothing more to lose, and she kept on telling herself that. Even as the Soviets rushed over, rustling the paper with the breeze stirred by their boots; even as she lay ready to die, ready to live, tired as a nation at the end of his time. There was plenty of dust, and plenty of blood, and her body ached. It fit-it all fit. The yoke had been laid over her shoulders-the niggling thought that it was cracked brought no satisfaction: the Soviets still had claim laid over the land fought so hard for: Everything I\"ve done, she thought, as a cough formed within her throat, was for my people. Her thoughts flickered, at Roderich, at Gilbert-if she could not fight, she could marry, or give herself over; but she could fight, she merely needed the mentality rather than the plentiful physique: that was why she was in...this. \"Fuck,\" she breathed, eyes shut against the world. The last soldier soon disappeared through the limits of sound; peace and dust remained-not one stray man was left, no one else to strap the lead to her bones. Limbs aching, heart aching, mind aching, she lay there among the debris- No wonder, then, said the idle mind; she could have scowled, but it would have hurt too much-coughing did not help: if it stayed, it hurt the throat; if it was released, it cut the throat; the effort of checking it racked the whole body, and there was none of it anyway. Head lolling back, Elizaveta felt the paper, the finger, lying dead on the ground: Russia had dropped it, mockingly, to replace the grave flowers. There were no flowers, aside from those withered things in her hair. They were papery. Still, being near dead...the well of strength was dry. There was but moisture left in the moss growing upon the clammy stone-up the frozen cylinder it traveled, and so she flinched when the hand came. It was cold. Cold-and yet, hot as ice-white and freezing; the touch was familiar. It was light as a feather. The feather was upon the shoulder; it pressed, though not harshly; still, it could not be described as gentle. The hand was frail as her strength-brittle and cold and old. She refused to open her eyes then. She had decided, some time ago, that she liked the dark. She preferred it; it was friendly, and it allowed ignorance to be an excuse. It was kind, and she wished it could be a closer friend. But white-why white... \"Hey,\" said something, someone, something, someone. The ax scraped against the stone; it rasped with a familiar tinge of the past months, which were long as eternity, significant as the rest of time\"s children. It was a beautifully ugly voice, salty, bloody, white as fire. In the next moment there was nothing but one thing-it could not be. The pressure increased, it was beginning to hurt. Not able to growl, Elizaveta shifted with painful instinct-another cough ripped through her chest. \"Hey,\" said something again, and she summoned what was left of the moisture in the moss to flick her eyes open-it hurt: her eyes stung in white with water, but she knew it would come to pass. Everything comes to pass. Everything-absolutely everything: she had to keep on telling herself that, for though it passed, it took its very sweet time doing so; so that she could almost taste the bitter sparks on her tongue; it was parched, and thus drier. Spice. \"Fuck you,\" she whistled through her throat. It stung. It could not be. The pressure increased, not unexpectedly; it squeezed upon her shoulder, and it took a large muster of strength to finally blink the fluids away from the eyes, so that they were a clear green again-the first sight was white, as it always was-the second blink brought the sight of red, and some part of her-somewhere, deep down or hidden-despaired: agony nudged at her again, and she knew that those papers would not have been so kind as to let her go: no, she had to confront; it was a gift of something...that would not irk her for the rest of eternity, and yet a curse of more pain. The choice of selfishness or selflessness, when both loosed their boundaries and came together. And that hurt. More than anything, that hurt-the scorch of disappointment; denial, anxiety, fear-there was too much of it. And yet, she did not want him dead. It had taken her time, so much time to realize that...but she did not wish death upon anyone, having seen too much of it as the clock ticked away-she had never wanted anyone to truly die. Gilbert Beilschmidt, though she hated him above all, was no exception. But in times such as now, when war tore the world apart-when history decided to twist itself about-when the nations crumbled-how could death not be a blessing?-at this point she could almost want them all to be dead. Roderich, Gilbert, Veneziano, Ludwig...and yet she would watch with relief on the day that each of them would pick themselves up, and charge into the distance with life. She hated war. She blinked rapidly, staring, always watching; though she ached, she let the next batter of coughing come to pass-shock, it overcame her then. Charging upward, body screaming in protest, she could only slap him with strength that came by habit, before wrapping both arms around him, wondering how and why in hell- \"Get off me, woman!\" he protested, attempting to flail; she saw now that the tin had been stripped away, or at least most of it, as she felt him, flesh and cloth and hair-from the unhealthy pallor of his skin, from the dried hard uniform, to the pinked and browned hair, silver still shining boldly beneath the blood. He was unusually warm-hot even-when she felt him; clearly the cold had been warded off, though his hands still felt like ice; remembering the documents found in Ludwig\"s office, she realized that it was fever. But his head-feeling about the neck, she knew it was there-desperately feeling, just to know how cruel death was, she felt it, finding no seam-with a thin cry of joy and pain she kissed it, squeezing him till he was strangled- \"You\"re alive,\" she breathed, even as garbled speech flew from his lips. She was going into spasms-this was too unreal! And yet it was. He was so, so solid. His eyes were ruby. No petty pink glaze upon the Kingdom of Prussia\"s gaze-no death frosting them over. Clinging to him, something told her that she would never let go-a stupid little piece of wishful thought, no doubt: never let go, how ridiculous; and yet she did not release him, as he calmed between her limbs, resigning with guilty pleasure, rigid with denial. She could not even loosen about him-there was nothing but the jail scene playing and replaying itself in her mind-letting their hands drop, parting, and then the sickening sound of the guillotine\"s strike. Water, red, pink, silver, white, black. The swastika rose over all, as if to mock... \"Where in Isten\"s name have you been?\" she muttered against his shoulder, before lifting her head away hastily; still, though, she did not let go; she wanted to savor it. As the vampire feasts on blood. The scent of metal clung to him. \"Get off,\" was the obstinate reply; she lifted her hand and slapped him again, not knowing what else to do. \"Ow!\" \"Where\"ve you been?\" she said again. \"You were supposed to be dead-\" \"Well, I\"m so freaking not-\" \"I saw your head!\" she said, voice reaching a higher octave. \"It was a fake!\" \"Impossible,\" she declared, eyes widening before she finished; it came to her, suddenly-the way it had fallen, the sudden hush of death, the blindfold of stars, the blood-she had seen it, touched it, waded in the water it buried itself in.... She had suffered with him at death. \"You were dead...,\" she whispered; it gave way to coughing, and he only watched as she did; held onto her and she held onto him. \"I heard the thud. If you were dead-\" He grunted. When she looked up, his eyes were a bitter red. \"The head was fake. They...held me down.\" Scowling, he looked away; admittance was ignominy. \"They held me down up there. There were lots of them, Hungary-scheiße, there was a lot of back-up that we didn\"t notice; I couldn\"t beat off all of them. And my gun ran out...\" His voice faded; still, his scowl deepened, and he finished to his own satisfaction. \"Their leader was fun to kill though.\" He laughed, cruelly, forcefully-he found no love for death, though he had seen enough of it to mind less. Elizaveta decided against shaking her head-it could only be true; she had known him for years, since they were incomplete nations, just children running about with swords of both wood and steel. Just as he had sifted out her identity from that of Elisabeth Wertheim\"s, it was with ease that she found that this man in front of her was real: as nations in human form, they were allowed the same detached senses as those immortal. Stupid, she scolded herself, knowing not to trust so easily; but it was what it was. She noticed the shards of tin still upon his flesh then-of course, he could not have been thrown out so easily-time was needed, so much time; some things did not change, but could. They trapped him. Shackled his person. Still not releasing-he was too real, too solid, to let go-she let the glimpses of his uniform and body form in her mind; she looked about, saw the blood, the bruises, the sickly pallor of his skin. Dread formed with it, in a way almost instinctive, be it Gilbert or not: \"What did they do to you.\" It was not a question-it was an exclamation, asking, wondering, but not questioning. The papers came to mind again. A pause-it was too long, in Elizaveta\"s mind. With a ferociousness that came at will, that sapped her meager strength as well as supplied it, she asked, this time, demanded, \"What did they do to you?\" He was biting his lips, not speaking; still, obstinately, she took him by the shoulders again, harder, saying, \"What did they do to you?\" The papers came to mind again...how Ludwig had admitted it, how Gilbert had been so emotionless for the past year.... A protectiveness that she had never felt before, for but Roderich and Veneziano, but never this man, emerged; it reared its head menacingly-some maternal side of her glared outwards, and she shook him. \"Tell me!\" He only bit his lips harder. \"Tell me, God damn it,\" she said. \"I found documents in Ludwig\"s office. Is it true...\" he looked at her \"...that, throughout the war....\" \"Ja,\" he said, finally; his tone shook at the slightest, but was steely at the same time. His eyes grew hard. Elizaveta had never seen him like this, before the war-so close to tiredness, so close to a sort of trauma; he spread trauma, he did not suffer from it. She had known him for so long, and yet finally.... Not noticing how hard she was holding onto him, as if to crush him, she leaned in with complete urgency, green pools of eyes reflecting the cracked image of Gilbert Beilschmidt. \"Russia...hurt my people. So much.\" He snorted softly, in disgust. \"And der Führer\"-derision-\"doesn\"t like me a lot.\" The line along his brows became harsh, harsher than they needed to be. \"My people aren\"t West\"s. They\"re different. And they don\"t like der fucking Führer.\\', \\'SilverGray lll...YellowRagged llll...GrayMillie...CrowFeather ll SquirrelBramble lll...SquirrelAsh...TigerSasha...WhiteWillow SorrelBracken ll...StormSquirrel llll...LeopardHawk l...DaisySmoky CloudDaisy l...CloudBright ll...AshNight ...MinnowMouse BlueBarley l...FuzzViolet...MouseRunning ll...ShrewWhite l HawkPick a cat!

Anyway, I got a little carried away in the last pairing, what with all the shunning, pride, acknowledgement and prejudice; I think Naruto has gone way past into my head OO\" I\"m serious, at the first episode, there was all that attention stuff, loneliness, existence, blah, blah, blah and I was like \"Hey! That\"s exactly how I feel!\" Naruto has reminded me of the honor and determination I learned when I was barely over seven years of age, so I\"m addicted to it. Darren\"s Wings Thanks! Fuzz is a kittypet and his owner is a vet, well, I think the owner\"s a vet. The owner healed Barley and his sister. Barley\"s sister is Violet and their brothers, Snake and Ice, were Scourge\"s personal guards. You can read about them in Secrets of The Clans. Allan pike I totally agree. Love should not be forbidden! ANGELA Hm, nothing implies a love interest yet, but I\"m out on watch for it! HOLLYPAW, FALL IN LOVE! Yellowfang I\"m dying... The black is pressing on me, splotches of darkness appearing in my vision, blurring the image of the tom before me. Fireheart...the son I never carried. He was always a better son than Brokentail. Brokentail, traitor, murderer, someone I probably should not call a son, but I still loved him, because he was my flesh and blood. Mine and Raggedstar\"s. I\"m dying, my life is flashing before my eyes, letting me see the story I have looked at with my gaze. Raggedstar...was a great cat. I loved him, truly, I did. He was brave, honest, a great leader whom I have known for as long as I can remember. I can feel it, sense it, horribly, my breathing is slowing down. It\"s harsh, raspy, grating, like drawing a claw slowly across a bone, sunk deep. I\"m going... If this is dying, it is not horrid. It\"s actually...comforting, knowing that your pain will end soon, you\"ll unravel and reach up into the skies. So, this is the end. I hear those whispers, achingly familiar, Raggedstar\"s whispers, being pushed into my head, gently, flowing like a steady stream and I suddenly feel Raggedstar beside me. He has flown down, into my presence, to welcome me into the Great Beyond, to help me there, gently, knowing that we could love each other there without breaking a code. I have told Firestar that I had killed my own son, let him know of what has haunted me for what seemed to be forever. There is no need to look at myself as I leave this world. I could tell that my fur is burnt, dulled and I know that things will be better in Silverpelt. It\"s just like that. I dearly hope that StarClan will forgive me for all my wrongs. All these jabs of pain, invisible puddles of ice-cold wate, regret and terror, the warmth in my heart at being able to see the son I have never been the blood of...brings tremors to the body I have always inhabited. It\"s horrid: Patchpelt and Halftail, both dead. StarClan, keep them. There is some sort of consciousness beside me, warm, tingling. I can feel it, materializing. I feel that sudden warmth beside me, blow on my fur, as if to blow off the soot. Raggedstar? Raggedstar! I could feel that sort of warmth that comes up suddenly. I hear... I feel...his presence. It cannot be explained unless one feels themselves. I don\"t know, I just hear him now... No, it\"s like thoughts but...I\"m conscious of everything around me. I\"m caught between two worlds: this place I have walked physically and my mind, a mental place of its own. It\"s like thinking...but I\"m not losing concentration on this physical world. Thinking... I\"ve always defined it as feeling thoughts, but I\"ve never found the words to explain it before. The world is strange that way. There\"s a heaving mass of energy in my chest now, all in my sorrow, remembering how I\"ve loved Raggedstar, but couldn\"t, how he was happy that I was carrying his kits, how I had to lose my daughters right at their birth, how I had to stand to see my son throughout his life but never knowing his kinship with me, seeing him become a monster, losing Raggedstar and then killing my only son. Fireheart helped me... He brought me to ThunderClan and I found a new family. I found two new kits who did not share my blood: Cinderpelt and Fireheart. Now, I\"m going to have Raggedstar back, dear Raggedstar. I feel the warmth coming over me, so comforting and I suddenly invite it, with all the warmth I could muster for it. I hear whispers...coming in my head... Raggedstar... I close my eyes, slowly, because I want to at least see this world one last time... I do not meet darkness, for the first time, upon shutting my eyes, and the last time. I could hear Fireheart\"s cries to me...but I ignore them... I hear the sound, but not the words. To bask in my true son\"s voice...one more time. Good-bye... \"Yellowfang.\" I can hear the voice, that voice of Raggedstar, replacing Fireheart\"s. I find myself standing up, feeling like the time I had become an apprentice for the first time. I\"m all right now. I could see my body, a useless lump of dark, but I could see Fireheart. I turn, tearing my eyes away from him in his grief to see my beloved. There he is, the one I have craved to see. Oh, he hasn\"t changed a bit. As always, he is there, proud stature, with his unkept gray pelt, his thin tail high in the air, his proud amber eyes that always gleamed. I purr, find myself doing so, knowing that he is there. I see him again. I can. He is there, my beloved and I find myself padding quickly towards him. To feel him again...to tell him how much I love him, to know that he loves me. Peace at last. It comes to me and we\"re together, this time, knowing that it isn\"t against the code and not having to break apart again. We are together... ... Forever... PT: Please understand this. I have tried to put lots of thought into it. Er...

I\"ve got no religion, so it doesn\"t hurt ME in any way, other than the fact that my divorced dad is Christian and I live across a Catholic church.

Sorreltail: Demi... -PT looks up at note- PT: Holy crap, that\"s a long rant. Darren\"s Wings Thanks again! OMG, I can\"t believe I forgot about Birchfall and Applekit! -Bangs head on table- Anyway, yeah, that fic on Katrina is brilliant! Love it! Silverstream So, this is StarClan\"s punishment. I\"m dead, now, but I can\"t believe it. I\"m dead. I repeat it, as if it\"s the only way to make it seem real. I\"m dead. No matter how much I repeat it, it\"s still unbelievable. How could StarClan do this to me? I love Graystripe, but I can\"t love my kits? I can\"t show them my love, be there for them? I stand here, with my mother\"s tail around my shoulders - all I do is stare at Graystripe, my kits, Fireheart, Cinderpelt and Tigerstar. Graystripe is wailing in grief at the body I have left behind. Oh, I so want to help him. I want to comfort him, but I keep standing my ground. It\"s the shock, the grief. I unconsciously unsheathe my claws and attempt to dig them into the incredibly hard rock beneath my paws. I want to feel this rock, feel the solid hardness, to feel it, reassure myself that, as long as I am touching the ground, that I\"m still here. Then, maybe I can comfort Graystripe. I want to stay alive. I want to watch my kits grow up, to see them become strong, fine warriors, maybe eben Clan leaders. Yet, most of all, I want to live to be with Graystripe. My claws scrape against this solid stone, not penetrating it. I insistently sink my claws in more. I grip the earth, because I don\"t want to leave - I can\"t leave. I can\"t leave! I CAN\"T LEAVE!! I DON\"T WANT TO LEAVE!! I can\"t leave! I don\"t want to leave! I don\"t want to die!! I don\"t! I DON\"T!! I WON\"T!! If I leave - if I die - who will take care of my kits? Father will be devastated! Mother\"s already died from blackcough when I was only an apprentice. I\"m the only family he has left. I can\"t just die and leave. He\"s my father. Crookedstar is my father and the only one I have left; I\"m the only one he has. I\"ll gain my mother when I join StarClan, but then my kits will be alone. They\"ll have no mother. Their father will be in a different Clan...if the kits won\"t end up as part of ThunderClan. Which Clan will they be part of? Why did I fall in love with Graystripe? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? WHY? WHY - did I fall in love with him? Why did he fall in love with me? Why did I? If I we hadn\"t loved each other, none of this would have happened. I wouldn\"t have carried Graystripe\"s kits. I wouldn\"t have to die - to leave the ranks of the living. To leave father. To leave RiverClan. Yet, what I mourn the most...is that I have to die and leave my love. My mate. My Graystripe. The handsome gray tabby, with those amber eyes that always glowed at me, always kind. Always the same amber eyes that held my gaze lovingly. Always. The eyes would always give me a deep feeling, penetrate me with a kind of warmth, a kind of love that penetrated, penetrated - penetrated me so hard - that it hurt. It killed me. Yet, I still invited that pain. I loved it. The pain told me how much I loved Graystripe. That pain hurt, but I loved it, hard. I loved it incredibly hard. I can\"t give it a name, but the pain came whenever I thought of Graystripe, and it hit hard. I invited it - I basked in it. It was probably love. Fierce love. A kind of love that was so painful in its own way, I loved it, that it was something good. A kind of pain that was good. A kind of pain that\"s not so painful at all. How strange. Many a night, perhaps a mere free moment, I would just press close to this tabby I loved. No one ever found out. I\"d gaze into those eyes, feeling that pain that didn\"t even hurt. I\"d press closer, feeling his warmth, feeling him. Feeling his love. He\"d press in closer as well and we\"d gaze into each others eyes. His eyes would stare at me, and I\"d stare back, lost in the amber depths. Lost. How I loved those nights, so fiercely, so hard. I\"d wish they\"d last forever. Oh, how I wish it were so now. I wouldn\"t be dying and leaving everything behind. I want Graystripe. I want him, even more as I stare at him hungrily. Him wailing with grief. My heart is shattering. It\"s going, the love and sorrow now drilling into me, this time really hurting. Not like that love that didn\"t hurt, but hurt at the same time. This pain... I feel myself pulling away. I open my mouth in a wail. My mother is guiding me away, on to StarClan. No! Yet, my limbs disobey me. They\"re going, obediently padding for StarClan. I stare at Graystripe. I can hear myself yowling his name, desperate, longing. \"GRAYSTRIPE!!\" He does not look up. Oh Graystripe, no. He just wails my name in grief and I want to be there. \"I\"m sorry,\" mother murmurs. I act as if I don\"t hear. I just want Graystripe. \"I know how you feel. I felt the same way when I died. I left you and your father alone. I\"m sorry this pain must be known to you as well.\" I barely hear. \"GRAYSTRIPE!!\" Graystripe No...Silverstream. I stare at Silverstream\"s bloodstained body through a blurriness in my eyes. Don\"t leave me! What will I do without you? The kits need you! Your father needs you! Your Clan needs you! I need you! Don\"t go, Silverstream!! I tilt my head upward; everything is a confusion of pain and tears. \"SILVERSTREAM!!\" I wail. That name, I repeat it: it\"s a name of a cat that I loved so much. It\"s like saying her name will do anything bring her back to me. I need her. \"SIL-VER...STREAM!!\" DON\"T LEAVE ME!! Please...DON\"T!! You can\"t be dead! DON\"T GO! Stay with me! \"SILVERSTREAM!!\" PT: There we go! Hope you liked it!! Sorry for missing out on updates TT.TT Good God. OH NO, THERE WE GO AGAIN!! I\"ve been saying \"Good God\" instead of OMG these days... Too much 1776. Sorreltail: Kay... Review! PT: I might update slower than usual. Summer stuff, you know. Sorreltail: Constructive criticism! PT: That pain thing Silverstream talks about comes up with love, really. I\"ve felt it before, but it wasn\"t real love. It was school crushing. Sorreltail: Vote! PT: See you!!

ED IS SO KAWAAAAAAAAAIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII!! \"...\" -Squirrelflight knocks her out- Sandstorm: Sorry about that; she\"s been reading Full Metal Alchemist lately and...well, she\"s fangirling the main character. Btw, here\"s a note she wrote in case I knock her out: ED! Erm...sorry for the late update. I\"ve had slight writer\"s block that\"s been affecting the updating of a lot of my stories. The updates might get slower; it\"s been more than a month since I\"ve last updated. Please forgive me D: Go on my profile! At the bottom, there\"s a DeviantArt link. Click it!! It\"ll bring you straight to my deviation! Yes, I have a DA account now. I made a CrowFeather fanart on Paint. I wrote a fanfic thingy to go with it in the Artist\"s Comments. I\"m sorry, I barely had time to write it; I only had a few minutes. Three minutes, I think. I noticed that a lot of members of fanfic are part of DA. I found some...including some of you out there -Looks at computer screen suspiciously- shadilverluvr Like, HOW do they not make any sense!? I\"m sorry, but I lose my temper easily and, really, you should EXPLAIN how the oneshots make no sense. -Hope- In the Name of Love Yeah, she did spazz out. I was thinking dramatic and everything. Plus, there\"s the fact that Silverstream was young. I can\"t believe that she\"d be creepily calm about this. Darren\"s Wings Yeah, I know how to reply, but I prefer to do it this way. Unless you would prefer that I do it the way people usually do on FF. That\"s fine. Yeah, I\"ve read Flamestar Speaks: Flamestar\"s Forgotten Tale when I read your review. It really is great! :D I love the plot SO much, like OMG! It\"s so suspenseful and I don\"t mind if cats get too Mary Sue-ish! It\"s actually really perfect! Well, about the Da Vinci Code... This is rather unfortunate, but it does say some things disrespectful to Christianity. Yeah, you would have to read the book. Sorry :( On a brighter note, thanks for the constructive criticism and everything; I was really happy. In fact, I was practically jumping up and down in joy :) Feathertail I\"m dead. I\"ve been dead for a while now. It\"s been a couple of moons, I believe. You lose all sense of time up here, in this place. I\"ve gotten confused. It\"s nice up here with StarClan. It\"s certainly good that I know my mother now. She\"s wonderful. I feel safe and free, a kind of bubbling warmth in my being-but my problems aren\"t over. I\"ve seen Crowfeather, still alive, living as a WindClan warrior. I\"m proud of him-proud that he\"s such a good warrior...but... It\"s just that...he\"s with Nightcloud. It\"s just that-I know Crowfeather doesn\"t truly love her. He tries to, but he mated with her in the first place to prove his loyalty to WindClan. I feel for him, but whenever I look at Nightcloud, I have an urge to yowl in her face. A heat boils up within my being; the heat of anger wells up and struggles to escape me. I\"ve never let anyone know how I feel-not even Silverstream. Nightcloud...she loves Crowfeather, but she\"s selfish, arrogant and incredibly possessive of her mate and kit. She treats Leafpool unkindly, trying to tell her that Crowfeather\"s hers. Can\"t she understand how she feels? How much pain Leafpool had, and is, going through? Cold guilt fills in my chest to hate Nightcloud, but I can\"t bear her at times. Does she not know how lucky she is-she is Crowfeather\"s only mate who is allowed to stay with him. I am dead; Leafpool is bound by loyalty. Loyalty to her Clan, the warrior code, loyalty and guilt for Cinderpelt. Oh, Crowfeather-so confused, hurt, filled with pain. The pain is with me as well. I don\"t regret trying to save his life with mine, but I wonder if it was worth it. Would it have been better if we had died together? This thought horrifies me. But, if Crowfeather had died as well as I, he wouldn\"t have to experience the pain coursing throughout his body-would he? I\"ll never know. Yet, I still so want to bring him up with me... Is that selfish? Crowfeather... This pain of watching him going through what is going through now-him hurting, while I\"m up here, hunting with StarClan, not able to do anything about it. His heart has broken, and it cannot be mended. I wish I could fix that. I need to fix that. I cannot sit by, knowing that he\"s dying within himself. But, it\"s too late to help now. I\"ve lost him...in more ways than one. PT: So...short, but my head\"s going through extreme writers\" block now. I mean, seriously! I\"ve gone off my usual updating schedule on my other Warriors fic and I\"ve been going through tons of drafts for the next update of my FMA fic. That\"s not to mention my CDF fic, my...well, you get the point. I\"ve noticed that I\"ve been bashing Nightcloud and ShadowClan too hard. Mark me, I don\"t like them, but ShadowClan\"s just too arrogant and Nightcloud is.... Well, I just read Cats of The Clans and I feel the same way as Rock feels about her. Except, there\"s the fact that I think she really does love Crowfeather, but hurts that he doesn\"t love her back. ShadowClan\"s amazingly proud; I still haven\"t forgotten that they just watched and jeered while Berrypaw was still a helpless kit caught in a fox-trap. I\"m still amazingly mad about it. If I don\"t update real soon, you\"ll have to wait a while. Summer just started for me here in New York; today was the last day of school. My aunt just called today. I\"m going back to Canada this summer. It\"s not Toronto for once. So, yeah, I won\"t be back for a while. I\"m going to update my other fics and tell readers that I\"m going to be off for a while, unless there\"s a change of plans. You never know with my family. Well, see ya. P.S. I GRADUATED DESPITE MY BAD MATH GRADES!! I\"M GOING TO EIGHTH GRADE! W00T!! I\"m pretty sure you don\"t care, but I\"m just so happy! :D Sandstorm: Damn, you\"re awake again. -Squirrelflight knocks PT over the head with a dead frog- -PT passes out- HeatherLion llll...GoldenTiger l...NightCrow lllll...CinderJay ll JayPoppy llll...CinderLittle lllllll...FireSpotted lllll...FernDust llllllll FireSand llllll...StormBrook llllll...BlueOak ll...YellowRunning l AppleBirch l...LeopardTall lllll...GrayMillie l...
